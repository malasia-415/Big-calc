Here this app will allow you to make calculations of your calorie intake for every meal simply type in the number of calories of the meal or snack that you are eating with the letter 'C' that stands for calories. Once you click on the clear button, the calculations will then save into a dropbox that you can see when you click inside the black box. You can then click on a calculation that was made and edit it, or you can delete it in the dropbox.
